This folder acts as a helper for quickly updating forms within the designer and app.

The root level should contain a `framework.xlsx` file.

The tables folder should contain the nested folder structure for ODK Tables, e.g.,

```
tables/
  exampleTable/
    forms/
      exampleTable/
        exampleTable.xlsx
```
