Additional SVG Icons can be added here.
Good sources of icons include:

- https://thenounproject.com/
- https://www.flaticon.com/

Once included they need to be registered in `src/app/modules/shared/components/material.components.ts`
And then can be used as part of `<mat-icon svgName="..."></mat-icon>`
